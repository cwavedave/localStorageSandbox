<h2> About </h2>
Used sessionStorage to pass data between pages

sessionStorage maintains the data in the browser until the session has ended ( browser closed ), so it is much more applicable for passing data across form pages for example

<h2> Tested on </h2>
Works incognito / on Safari / Chrome 

Easy way to test is to load the form-2.html page by itself and check javascript console - exception handling will show the data has not been passed yet. 

<h2> Languages used </h2> 
<ul> <li> HTML(5) </li> <li> Javascript </li> </ul>
